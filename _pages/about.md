I am a South Carolina native. After living in Baltimore for my undergraduate
degree, I moved back to South Carolina to get my PhD from the <a
href='https://sc.edu'>University of
South Carolina</a>. My current advisor is <a
href='https://people.math.sc.edu/androula/'>Dr. George Androulakis</a>. Before
becoming his student, I was advised by the late <a
href='https://people.math.sc.edu/nyikos/'>Dr. Peter Nyikos</a>. 

My current academic interests include: quantum information and statistics,
mathematical foundations of physics, classical statistics, and functional
analysis. In particular, I am interested in the inverse space
problem of Weyl-Wigner Quantization and generalizing Shannon's entropy theorem
to the quantum setting.

I was trained by Dr. Nyikos in set-theoretic topology. My interests there were:
Cp Space theory, topologies on trees, and classifying generators for Tychonoff
spaces. 

In 2023, I was awarded a <a href="https://www.borenawards.org/">David L. Boren Fellowship</a> through the National
Security Education Program. I spent the 2023-2024 academic year studying the
Korean language at Sogang University's Korean Language Education Center in
Seoul, South Korea.

professional experience.
