This post is inspired by this <a
href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25449122">paper</a> by D. Shlyakhtenko (<a
href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0510103"> arxiv link to similar result</a>).
While reading this paper, I came across some notation in formula in the statement of lemma
4 that I was unfamiliar with

$$ 
f\left( \sum_{i=1}^{N+1} X^{(k)}_{i}
: \left\{\sum_{i=1}^{N+1}X^{(r)}_{i}\right\}_{r\neq k}\right)
= E_{W^{\star}\left(\left\{\sum_{i=1}^{N+1} X^{(r)}_{i}\right\}_{r=1}^{n}\right)}f\left(\sum_{i\neq j}X_{i}^{(k)}
: \left\{\sum_{i \neq j} X_{i}^{(r)}\right\}_{r \neq k},
\left\{X_{j}^{r}\right\}_{r=1}^{n}\right)
$$

In particular, what is this 

$$E_{W^{\star}\left(\left\{\sum_{i=1}^{N+1} X^{(r)}_{i}\right\}_{r=1}^{n}\right)}$$

and what does this mean? My advisor told me that the $$E$$ represents a conditional expectation and the $$W^\star$$ 
represents a von-Neumann subalgebra. So, the goal of this post is to unpack this notation entirely.

The standard definition of conditional expectation takes place in the arena of
some probability space $$(\Omega, \Sigma, \mathcal{P})$$ with two random
variables $$X$$ and $$Y$$. Then, intuitively, we can construct a new random
variable $$Z = E[X|Y]$$. This new random variable gives us the expectation of
$$X$$ given $$Y$$ occurs. A simple example of this given on the <a

wikiepdia page</a> for conditional expectation. However,
